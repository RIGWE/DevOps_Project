Git Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system. Git solves the problem of sharing source code efficiently and keeping track of changes made to source code.

Git allows developers make their own copy of the central repository and this is why it is referred to as a `Distributed Version Control System`

Git Branch helps create a different copy of your source code. 

inthe new brach, changes can be made as much as you want. the changes are independent of what is in the main copy.

Git Branch is `commonly used to develop new feature of your application`, and that `the initial code is untested` and as such can not be added to the code base of your live application

## Clonning Remot Git Repository

We need a local copy of our remote repository.

The `git clone` command helps us `make a copy of remote repository` in our local machine.
